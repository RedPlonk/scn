Package Installation and Management
===================================

- Part 5: Package Installation and Management
  - Commands: apt, yum, /ports
  - Packages and package management

Here are practical exercises for each of the package management commands and systems used in various Linux distributions, specifically `apt` for Debian-based systems, `yum` for Red Hat-based systems, and the FreeBSD Ports collection (`/ports`). These exercises will provide hands-on experience with installing, updating, and managing software packages.

### Exercise Set for `apt` (Advanced Packaging Tool)
**Exercise 1:** Update Package List

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `sudo apt update` to refresh your system's package list. This ensures you have the latest versions of packages available for installation.
3. Observe the output as `apt` retrieves new package data from configured repositories.

**Exercise 2:** Install a Package

1. Choose a software package to install. For example, letâ€™s install `htop`, a system-monitoring utility.
2. Use `sudo apt install htop`.
3. After installation, type `htop` to run the program and ensure it was installed correctly.

### Exercise Set for `yum` (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)
**Exercise 1:** Search for a Package

1. Open your terminal on a Red Hat-based system.
2. Type `yum search nano` to search for the nano text editor package.
3. Review the output to see if the package is available for installation.

**Exercise 2:** Install and Update Software

1. Install nano using `sudo yum install nano`.
2. After installation, check for updates specifically for the nano package by typing `sudo yum update nano`.

### Exercise Set for FreeBSD Ports (/ports)
The FreeBSD Ports collection is a system of directories that simplifies the process of installing and managing software on the FreeBSD operating system.

**Exercise 1:** Navigating the Ports Tree

1. Assuming you are on a FreeBSD system, navigate to the Ports collection using `cd /usr/ports`.
2. Use `ls` to list the categories of software available. Choose a category like `editors`.
3. Inside the editors directory, list the software packages available, e.g., `ls editors`.

**Exercise 2:** Installing Software from Ports

1. Navigate to a specific port you wish to install, e.g., `cd /usr/ports/editors/nano`.
2. Compile and install the software using `make install clean`. This command will fetch the source code, compile it, and install the resulting binaries and other files.
3. After installation, you can use the `nano` command to ensure it is working.
