Logging In
==========

- Part 1: Getting into the system
  - Commands: bash, login, ssh
  - Connecting to a far away computer.  

There are many ways to use Linux. To start learning, it's best to use the "Other" option below and do this through your internet browser.

Some ways to log in
-------------------------

Here's how you can connect to a Linux system.

Linux
----------

- You're at work and there’s a Linux computer in front of you with your login info on a paper. You turn on the computer, see lots of text, and now it asks for a "`Username`." What next?

Usually, you'll see a screen to type on. In the "`Username`" space, put in the **username** you were given and press `<ENTER>`. Then, it asks for a *password*. Put in the password and press `<ENTER>` again.

After hitting `<ENTER>` the second time, you should be in and see the main screen. Try clicking around to explore. Usually, there’s a menu for programs that works like the "Start" menu in Windows, or a "Search" box pops up when you click on Programs. When you're ready, type "**Terminal**" in this box and press enter. A black box with a "`$`" prompt will come up.

macOS
-----

- You use a macOS for drawing, but now you want to make websites. You got your first job and they gave you a place, user, and password and expect you to work on the website. How do you connect and log in safely?

macOS is close to Linux so you have many of the tools you need. Just like the first time, do the same steps. Then, go to Utilities and start Terminal. A black box with a "$" prompt will show up. Your job should have given you `ssh` info which you enter like this:

From the shell prompt:

`$`: **ssh** *user*@*host*

`Password`: < ExampleSecret > `<ENTER>`

Then another "`$`" prompt will show up.

Windows
-------

- You use a Windows computer at work and need to check the security of your Linux servers before an inspection, but you’ve never used a Linux server and need to know how to log in.

The fastest way to use Linux on a Windows computer is to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL. To do this on Windows 10 or later, open a Command Shell as "Run as Administrator" or open a PowerShell Window and type "wsl --install." Ubuntu Linux will install into a virtual machine which you can start as the application "Ubuntu." After that, you'll see a graphical interface and can follow the steps above.

Other
-----

- Finally, if you're just a little curious about Linux and don’t want to spend much time learning it right now but would still like to try it. How can you do that?

Go to **https://HostTheBox.com/** or **https://linux.farm/**

Click on the basic Linux version and a black box will open with a "`$`" prompt showing.
