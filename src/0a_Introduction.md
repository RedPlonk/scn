Introduction
============

Just as a city can’t operate without an infrastructure to provide electrical power, water, roads, government services, and other foundational resources, a computer requires a core program, called a *kernel*, that provides the basic services, and the supporting utilities together are known as the *operating system*.

A kernel is a bit like an air traffic controller, in that it coordinates all the programs, and the operating system is the airport. 

The five most widely-used operating systems in the world are Microsoft’s Windows and Apple’s MacOS for personal computers; Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android for smartphones and other smart devices; and Linux, which runs on an extraordinary range of devices, including supercomputers, web servers, personal computers, smartphones, and household appliances.

Unlike the other four operating systems, Linux isn’t proprietary; its code is publicly available (*open sourced*), free to all, and maintained and continually improved upon by a global community. The difference is similar to that of Wikipedia as compared to World Book or other branded encyclopedia. As a result, Linux is extremely customizable and adaptable; for example, it can run on almost any computer or smart device. It’s also exceptionally fast, stable, and secure, making it popular with a diverse range of groups ranging from corporations and government agencies to scientists and hobbyists.

This Book is For You If...
---------------------------

This book will help you understand and use the Linux operating system, and show you ways to optimize your productivity on Linux.

This book assumes no prior knowledge, so you’ll be able to understand it even if you’ve never used Linux before. That said, this book also provides progressively advanced information and tips as it goes on, so it will continue to be of immense use to you as you evolve from a novice to an intermediate user and power user.

At the same time, if you’re already an experienced Linux user, this book will help you move to even higher levels of knowledge. It can even help you prepare for getting professionally certified as a Linux expert.

There are many reasons you might be interested in Linux. For example, this book is for you if...

- The OS of the computer your employer assigned you is Linux
- You’re a software engineer, DevOps engineer, or web developer who needs the numerous software tools that run on Linux
- You’re a system administrator or network administrator seeking to leverage Linux’s stability, security, high degree of customization, and command line tools
- You’re about to work with a technology that typically depends on Linux, such as supercomputers, cloud computing, web servers, or cybersecurity
- You’re an embedded system developer who needs Linux’s ability to shrink to minimal size, work across a wide range of devices, and support (via patches such as RT-Preempt) the programming of highly time-dependent tasks
- You’re a data scientist or scientific researcher seeking to benefit from Linux’s transparency and customizability; the many scientific tools (for data analysis, simulations, etc.) that run on Linux; and the command line interface that can run scripts to automate tasks
- You’re a student who’s studying computer science and taking a course on Linux, or who simply wants to take advantage of your school making Linux available to you
- You like that Linux is open source, i.e., its code is always open to all, and is continually being improved by a global community

- You have issues with your personal computer’s current OS and want to explore switching to Linux because:
  - Linux installs, and updates, quicker and easier than a proprietary OS
  - Linux is leaner, and typically boots faster and runs faster, than a proprietary OS
  - Linux provides you with exceptional control, allowing you to custom-tailor the OS to your needs and tastes
  - Linux has a higher level of privacy, security, and stability than a proprietary OS
  - Linux has a simple and straightforward user interface
  - Linux’s command line lets you run customized scripts to automate and streamline your workflow
  - Linux provides tools to make its operation remarkably transparent,  and the Linux community is consistently transparent about problems, which typically makes troubleshooting issues easier on Linux than on a proprietary system
  - You have a personal computer that’s no longer supported by the current Windows or Apple OS, but that has no problem running the latest version of Linux
  - Linux is free

- Virtually all the cool nerds know and love Linux

Whatever the reason you’re interested in Linux, this book will help you to most effectively use Linux to meet your needs.


### Course Materials and Resources

All participants will have access to:

- Comprehensive course notes and guides
- A list of recommended reading and resources
- Access to a virtual lab environment for hands-on practice
- Community forums for discussion and troubleshooting

### Let's Get Started!

That covers all the preliminary information you need to know. You’re now ready to get started with Chapter 1, where you’ll learn how to interact with the Linux shell "bash" and learn why everything in Linux is a file.

Let's discuss some typographical notations:

| Notation          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **bold text**     | User input, commands, options, arguments, variables, and names of directories. |
| *italic text*     | Names of variables which are to be assigned (e.g., *password*). |
| `constant width`  | Linux command output, prompt signs, and output from commands. |
| `< >`             | Input that won't appear on the screen when pressed. For example, `<ENTER>`. |
| `<Ctrl-?>`        | Hold the control key while pressing another key. |
| `[ ]`             | Variables are optional. |
| `\|`               | Logical or, for example `[ arg1 \| arg2 ]` would represent choose arg1 or arg2. |
