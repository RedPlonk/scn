|-------------------|-------------|
| **bold text**     | User input, commands, options, arguments, variables, and names of directories. |
| *italic text*     | Names of variables which are to be assigned (e.g., *password*). |
| `constant width`  | Linux command output, prompt signs, and output from commands. |
| `< >`             | Input that won't appear on the screen when pressed. For example, `<ENTER>`. |
| `<Ctrl-?>`        | Hold the control key while pressing another key. |
| `[ ]`             | Variables are optional. |
| `|`               | Logical or, for example `[ arg1 | arg2 ]` would represent choose arg1 or arg2. |
